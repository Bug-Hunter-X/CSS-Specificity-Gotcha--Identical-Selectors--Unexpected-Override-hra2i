The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors and the cascading order:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special-div {
  color: red;
}

#my-div {
  color: green;
}

#my-div.special-div {
  color: purple;
}

/* This selector is more specific, but it's hidden by the selector below */
#my-div.special-div.extra {
  color: yellow;
}

#my-div.special-div.extra {
  color: orange;
}
```

In this scenario, the element with the id "my-div" and class "special-div" and class "extra" will have a `color` of orange instead of yellow. This is a classic example of specificity in action where the latter declaration overrides the former despite the fact that they are exactly the same, due to their placement in the CSS.
